. Preprocessing text data in Python


We will be using the same functions from the lesson Visualizing Text Data to preprocess the text data. The functions are:

load_text: loads the text from a txt file and returns a list of words;
prepare_text: preprocesses the text by removing stopwords, removing words with less than 3 characters, and transforming all words to lower case;
count_freq: counts the frequency of each word in the the document and returns a dataframe with the results.
